# A converting script for Google Play Music
Since Google Play Music doesn't support Hi-Res, this script is useful to:

1. Read ‘Unable to load these files’ list in your Google Play Music Settings.
2. Convert Hi-Res music files into ALAC format with CD quality.
3. Then you can try again to upload your files.
